# Yieldcat-feedback
My personal feedback from my hands-on experience on the YieldCat platform.

First and foremost, thank you for creating such a creative and challenging learning platform. As someone still in the early stages of the cybersecurity journey, YieldCat has pushed me to explore beyond the usual CTF/TryHackme/HTB environment, and put me in a more discrete, real-life, 'break things' scenario. This is a very rare and valuable opportunity.

That being said, I’d be glad to suggest one thing that could potentially improve the learning curve for users who are newer to web app security or who don’t have a strong web development background yet. Many cybersecurity-focused college programs, are usually more heavily network oriented, and offer (in my opinion) very minimal intro to web-dev, often a single course, which is not enough to confidently explore web security (such is my experience too).

Beginner's help 

YieldCat has real-world flavor and minimal hand-holding, which is probably amazing for advanced learners. But for students in their 2nd–4th year, who may not yet be fully fluent in web dev (or who want to bridge the theory-practice gap), a gentle push in the right direction could help a lot. These could be:

- Subtle hints or reminders
- Optional "sticky notes" or developer thoughts scattered through the platform to simulate what a senior (or the little devil) might whisper to a junior during an audit.

An idea to maybe even keep the existing approach - a platform that offers 3 difficulties - beginner, medium and hard (Names could be altered - e.g. n00b - h4x0r - 1337, rookie - veteran - nightmare or whoami - sudo - $ rm -rf /).

The easy mode would include the hints/help above. A few breadcrumbs would help more students experience that 'aha' moment without needing to guess what kind of bug they’re even supposed to be looking for.

The difficulty level is not a big issue — it is the initial traction. Once you get unstuck the first time or two, the learning flows smooth. Personally, I am extra grateful there was a workshop, because without it I would’ve been pretty lost on where to start. That guided push gave me direction and helped me engage with the platform better.

One more suggestion — YieldCat is already looking great so far, but I think that the interface and web app could also benefit from a team or person working on additional polishing, enhancing visuals and usability. The core functionality is already very solid and great, and this would just elevate the experience to feel even more professional and intuitive on the surface level.

All around, the platform is looking great and I think with time, and maybe with some help and a good team, it will keep evolving and be an amazing tool. 

I’m applying for the internship at BeyondMachines because I admire its mission to make all around cybersecurity accessible, comprehensive, and actionable, as well as the idea behind YieldCat and its educational value for students, engineers and enthusiasts alike. I’d be honored to contribute ideas and young padawan perspectives to help improve the learning experience for others like me.

Thank you very much for the opportunity. Kind regards, and May the Fourth be with you.
